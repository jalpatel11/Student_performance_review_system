# Student Performance Review System

## Project Overview

The **Student Performance Review System** is designed to simplify the performance analysis of students by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows easy interpretation of data. The system is intended for use by **Admins (teachers/faculty)**, **Students**, and **Parents** to visualize student progress and performance.

## Objectives

- Simplify the process of analyzing student performance.
- Represent student progress using an interactive and intuitive GUI.
  
## Key Features

1. **Admin Login**:
    - Faculty/Admins can log in using their credentials.
    - Upon successful login, they are redirected to the Faculty Page where student data can be accessed and managed.

2. **Student Login**:
    - Students log in with their credentials to view their own performance.
    - Upon successful login, students are redirected to the Student Details Page.

3. **Student Details Page**:
    - Displays students' marks and progress through visual graphs.
    - **Attendance Graph**: Shows a graphical report of attendance.
    - **Progress Graph**: Displays academic performance across various subjects, with areas of improvement highlighted.
    - **Remarks/Warnings Section**: Shows feedback and warnings issued to the student.

4. **Faculty Page**:
    - Displays faculty information and a list of students.
    - Clicking on a student's name or roll number redirects to their details page.
    - Allows admins to update student details and marks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the system.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SQLite**: For storing and retrieving student and faculty data.
  
## Impact

- Provides an easy-to-understand, visual representation of student data, enabling quicker insights into academic performance.
- Facilitates improved communication between faculty, students, and parents by providing real-time progress information.
